/*
Creating Object Literals
Objects can be assigned to variables just like any JavaScript type. We use curly braces, {}, to designate an object literal:

let spaceship = {}; // spaceship is an empty object

We fill an object with unordered data. This data is organized into key-value pairs. A key is like a variable name that points to a location in memory that holds a value.

A key’s value can be of any data type in the language including functions or other objects.

We make a key-value pair by writing the key’s name, or identifier, followed by a colon and then the value. We separate each key-value pair in an object literal with a comma (,). Keys are strings, but when we have a key that does not have any special characters in it, JavaScript allows us to omit the quotation marks:

let fasterShip = {
  color: 'silver',
  'Fuel Type': 'Turbo Fuel'
};
